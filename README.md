# basic GraphQL server
 GraphQL is a query language used for APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to retrieve and manipulate data. It was developed by Facebook and is now an open standard. GraphQL allows clients to specify exactly what data they need, and the server responds only with that data. This makes it more efficient and scalable than traditional RESTful APIs, as it reduces the number of round trips between the client and server. GraphQL also allows for better caching and more flexible data retrieval,
 making it a popular choice for modern web applications.
